**Is this domain really used by disposable email provider? Show us screenshots if possible.**

Specifically, please tell us where one can generate a disposable email address which uses that domain, so the maintainers can verify it.

**Can you create a PR yourself instead of an issue?**

Please consider taking the next step. This will improve your chances of fast merging and it really ain't hard. See details in the [readme](https://github.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing).
